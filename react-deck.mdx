## What is React?
- Front end Javascript library
- Can be used to create single-page or multi-page user interfaces

---
## Where does React fit?

<img src="./react-mvc.svg" style={{height:'50vh', width:'unset'}}/>

## List of potential topics
- Event handlers are difficult and verbose
- - Two way data bindings
- The DOM is very intensiveâ€”any manipulation to it tells the browser to perform a change
- - Using a Virtual DOM, we can alleviate this
- - Virtual DOM objects correspond to DOM objects, but dont trigger changes unless React tells it to [^1]
- Organizing code in a big javascript file sucks
- - Component architecture vs other paradigms
- Writing a server is a lot of work
- - Utilization of browser API-s like history to encroach on server-side functionality
- - React Router
- - Can focus on only writing API endpoints in your backend!

## List of confusing things about React
- JSX?
- Other tools that React often gets dumped together with: Webpack, npm, node, Express, create-react-app, Babel
- Why doesnt it look like javascript? ES6 classes as an abstraction of prototype architecture
- Organization of code
- - How this fit MVC
- - Components
- - Children
- - Parents
- - State
- - Props
- Lifecycle methods
- Why does a React project folder look so different?
- - Show how the build folder looks similar to what they are familiar with (but the .js files look like garbage)
- Why does it need to be built?
- - Compile? Not really, Webpack puts together "modules". Babel transpiles modern Javascript into older, compatible Javascript.
- Styling???
- - Vanilla CSS, Styled Components, Precompiled CSS


---

## Little gotchas
- setState()
- - Not the same as just changing the the class's state variable! Also tells React that a change occured and to re-render the element!
- Async function
- - Callbacks, Promises, async/await
- Composition > Inheritance
- Lifting up state
- JSX is not HTML, more similar to functional Javascript
- - {`<p hi="yeet">"yeeeet2"</p> <=> React.createElement("p", {hi: "yeet"}, "yeeeet2")`}
- - {`<p hi="yeet"><p>"nested"</p></p> <=> React.createElement("p", {hi: "yeet"}, React.createElement("p", null, "nested"))`}
